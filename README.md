## 🧠 Soft skills:

* Understanding of technical language

* Open to learning new technologies and techniques,

* Non-confrontational,

* Teamwork,

* Willingness to achieve goals,

* Communication skills.

## 💼 My activities at work:
- Develop and maintain RESTful API on Laravel for a video surveillance system: create and expand controllers, routes, models and resources, implement authentication and authorization of users and devices using middleware, implement processing of video streams, events and device management.
- Create effective database queries and optimize complex data models and Eloquent relationships (including hasMany, belongsToMany, and polymorphic relationships) for efficient information storage and processing.
- Write functional tests on PHPUnit to check the API logic, which allows me to detect and prevent regressions in a timely manner, reducing the number of errors and increasing the reliability of the system.
- Work with the Git version control system and the Bitbucket service: I create branches, create pull requests and merge changes, ensuring effective code management and team interaction.
- Document the API: describe endpoints, parameters, request/response formats, and possible error codes to support and simplify integration for frontend developers and API consumers.
- Work closely with the team in the framework of Agile, using Jira for task management and participation in daily stand-ups.
